# ProceduralTerrains
  ```Creating procedurally generated terrains ranging from voxelated to standard mesh rendering written in code.``` 

## Concepts Used:
  - Generating height maps using noise algorithms, namely Perlin Noise in this case.
  - Basics of how mesh rendering works in games and in unity with vertices, triangles, and quads through code.
  - Understanding Voxels and the optimization they bear in unity. (Unity isn't a voxel based engine in the first place).

A demo of the project showcased at my college, IIIT Kottayam's Tech Fest [Game Development and Design Workshop in Unity](https://youtu.be/P10JANuZn9o?t=4881) along with an added custom FPS tracker.
  
## Concepts to be implemented:
  - Marching Cubes algorithm to create more smooth and polygonal meshs(Octahedron meshes).
  - Infinites terrain generation (used in games like Minecraft, No Man's Sky, MMO's, etc).
  - Creating "Terrain Chunks" to optimize the lag spike in rendering.
  - Mesh Coloring and UV Mapping.
  - More Noise generation maps.
